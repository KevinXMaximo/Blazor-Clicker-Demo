# Blazor-Clicker-Demo
A demonstration of three different Blazor pages, one being a simplistic demo for a clicker game, the other being a demonstration for input and output through the squaring of a number, and the third being a todo list.

You can try the app out for yourself through the url: http://blazor-clicker-demo.azurewebsites.net/

Page 1: Clicker Demo

This page is a very simplistic prototype for a type of game known as a clicker game, where the player can click on different options in order to buy upgrades which can help in incrementing a counter. This type of game usually implements a real-time aspect to it with some upgrades passively increasing the counter at a set rate per second, but since this is only meant as a demonsration of the most basic essence of the genre, the program does not have those features.

Page 3: Todo

This page is an example of a to-do list, in which the user can add items and check them once those items have been completed. The code for this page follows the tutorial at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/build-a-blazor-app?view=aspnetcore-5.0&pivots=server
